# the mcmangler

This service generates a list of leetspeak candidates combined with common complex human appendages.

So for client Acme, it returns:

acme, Acme, ACME, @cme, @cme2017...

Until all possible combinations have been exhausted.

rules-whole and rules-root are processed with hashcat-utils/combipow to generate all the combinations.

The rules can be modified to your preference.
